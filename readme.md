# Tiny Robots, a minimal web framework that gets out of your way

## Directory

- `tiny-robots`, the installable library.
- `example`, a runnable, reployable demo of what Tiny Robots can do.

## Upstream bugs

- Snowpack/Rollup `hydratable` fix: https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/pull/2602. A workaround is hacked in.
- mdsvex sometimes fails to validate components in dev. This is usually fixed by re-saving the file.
