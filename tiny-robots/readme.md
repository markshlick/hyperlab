Tiny Robots is a frontend build system and microframework for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) designed for developer joy.

_Check out the code for this site [here](https://github.com/mkshio/tiny-robots/tree/master/example)._

### 🌈 Features

- 🔥 Ultrafast hot module replacement. Tiny Robots runs on [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) in development, so hot updates stay fast no matter how large your app gets.
- Hightly configurable universal data fetching. Routes can be eager or deferred.
- Static site generation with dynaic data loading. Just do `yarn run tr export`.
- Client side routing.
- Filesystem-based routing, with directory-based layouts and global app layout.
- Global CSS/JS support. Just create a `global` directory and it's contents will by inlined into every page.
- Markdown in your Svelte with [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.com/).

### 📦 Install

```shell
yarn add tiny-robots # or npm install tiny-robots
mkdir routes # application routes go here
mkdir static # static assets go here
mkdir global # global css/js goes here
touch index.html # HTML shell goes here
```

### 👩🏽‍💻 Develop

```shell
yarn run tr
```

Runs your app with [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/).

### 🚀 Ship

```shell
yarn run tr export
```

Generates static HTML pages and a client JS bundle with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/).

Adding `--dev` will produce a build for easier diagnostice, right now it just generates an unminified bundle, but more features may be added under the flag in the future.
